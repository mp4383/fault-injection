# Fault Injection

## Voltage Fault Injection

### What is Voltage Fault Injection
Voltage fault injection is a hardware attack technique where an attacker momentarily alters the supply voltage to induce faults in a systemâ€™s execution, often to bypass security checks or extract sensitive data.

```
bool pw_valid = password_check();
if (pw_valid) { // is 0 if false, 1 if true
  // ... sensitive operation
  printf("Your MFA Code is " + generate_auth_code());
}
```

In the example above, the boolean pw_valid is essentially a bit-flip. If we can corrupt this through voltage glitching it is possible to bypass the security check!


What can we do with Voltage Glitching?
- Gain access to debugging features on locked chips
- Bypass secure boot
- Code execution

### Anatomy of a Voltage Glitch
![Trigger, delay, and pulse](./images/trigger.png)
Here we have:
* trigger - device becomes powered
* delay - the time from trigger until the voltage drop
* pulse length - the time we drop the voltage

There are other parameters, such as pulse strength/amplitude, that are usable however are out of scope for this exercise.

### Glitching the nrfn52840
First we must provide a quick lesson in PCB architecture around chips like the nrfN52. These types of chips receive power through VDD, Voltage Drain Drain. In some instances it is possible to perform voltage fault injection by
pulsing here, however with this particular chip this is not ideal. Performing the glitch here would result in affecting other subsystems of the chip such as the radio and other voltage regulators, while we would like to isolate
the CPU core. By analyzing the chips data sheet, we can see that decoupling capacitor DEC1 has a link to the CPU core. If we perform the glitch here it will only affect the CPU core. 

We will be using the Faultier, a raspberry pi pico-based fault injection platform, Hextree's GlitchTag, a breakout board of the nrfN52840qfn48 that provides easy access to DEC1 on the chip, and some jumper wires.
The Faultier uses an n-channel MOSFET to perform the pulse by short-circuiting DEC1 to ground in what is called a "crow-bar" attack.

The important inputs from the faultier will be:
* Crowbar - we attach this to DEC1 and the MOSFET that after receiving a gate signal will be switched to ground, short circuiting and performing the glitch
* MUX0 - this is what we will use as the trigger to power on and off the device



## Hardware - Where to start
### Ben Eater
[eater.net](www.eater.net) - Kits and youtube videos for projects like building an 8-bit cpu from scratch or building a 6502 computer. The kits aren't a must have as you can get the knowledge from the videos, but it's definitely more fun to follow along.
